                        <p>Wavelet transform  provides a high temporal resolution, being ideally suited
                            for the analysis of sudden short-duration signal changes. We, therefore, implemented a
                            wavelet-based analysis for analyzing embolic signals and
                            have compared the results of this with a conventional FFTbased analysis. We examined their relative performance in
                            the analysis of embolic signals from patients with carotid
                            stenosis. The signals in such patients, which are believed to result from solid emboli, are of lower intensity so improved signal-processing approach might have particular benefit.</p>

                        <p>Like the Fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based time-frequency representation, a complete WT process creates a
                            2 (or 3)-dimensional representation with description of
                            time, wavelet scale (1/frequency), and amplitude of the
                            WT coefficients. The WT decomposes a time series into
                            time-scale space and enables one to determine both dominant modes of variability and how those modes vary in
                            time. The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is performed by projecting a signal s(t) onto a family of
                            zero-mean functions (the wavelets) deduced from an
                            elementary function C(t) (the mother wavelet) by translations and dilations.</p>

                        <p>The temporal resolution, as measured by the half-width maximum, was
                            significantly better for the continuous wavelet transform (CWT), mean (SD) 8.40 (8.82) ms, compared with the
                            128-point FFT, 12.92 (9.70) ms, and 64-point FFT, 10.80 (5.69) ms. Time localization of the CWT for the embolic
                            signal was also significantly better than the FFT. The wavelet transform appears well suited to the analysis of
                            embolic signals offering superior time resolution and time localization to the FFT.</p>
